Over the past couple of years, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) has exploded onto \\nthe world stage, with companies and individuals across the globe rapidly adopting the technology. The GCC is \\nplaying a lead role in the space, with business leaders in the region exploring ways of integrating this rapidly \\ndeveloping technology into their operations. \\nGenerative AI (GenAI) is being recognised as a game-changer for innovation in the region, empowering \\nenterprises by automating routine tasks, enhancing customer experiences and assisting in critical \\ndecision-making processes. Insights from our 27th Annual CEO Survey: Middle East ﬁndings have shown that \\n73% of CEOs in the Middle East believe GenAI will signiﬁcantly change the way their company creates, delivers \\nand captures value over the next three years1. GenAI is poised to make a signiﬁcant economic impact, with \\nestimates indicating that it could contribute between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually to global GDP across \\nvarious industries by 2030. In speciﬁc sectors, such as energy, investments in GenAI are expected to triple, \\nfrom $40 billion in 2023 to over $140 billion by the end of the decade. This surge in investment reﬂects the \\ntransformative potential of GenAI, particularly in enhancing productivity, streamlining business processes, and \\nreshaping value chains across industries2.\\nAgainst this backdrop, multimodal GenAI agentic frameworks has emerged as transformative catalysts, \\nenabling businesses to accelerate process automation at an unprecedented scale. This technology involves \\nmultiple AI agents working together, each specialising in diﬀerent tasks or data types, to solve complex \\nproblems and automate processes. By collaborating and constantly learning, these agents enhance \\ndecision-making, optimise processes, and drive innovation. It combines range of advanced AI techniques to \\nprocess diverse data types and automate complex tasks. \\nThe central question isn’t whether to adopt this technology, but how swiftly organisations can integrate it to \\nstay ahead of the competition. This executive playbook explores how organisations can leverage this \\ntechnology to boost operational eﬃciency, enhance customer experience, and drive revenue growth. It provides \\nreal-world success stories spanning industry sectors and organisational functions, strategic insights, tactical \\nblueprints, and best practices to guide your journey into this revolutionary landscape. \\nKey insights \\n●Agentic AI, diﬀerentiated by its advanced human-like reasoning and interaction capabilities, is \\ntransforming the manufacturing, healthcare, ﬁnance, retail, transportation, and energy sectors, among \\nothers. \\n●Organisations’ AI strategies should leverage multimodal GenAI capabilities while ensuring ethical AI \\nsafeguards to drive autonomous process re-engineering and enhanced decision-making across all lines \\nof business. \\n●Integrated eﬀectively, agentic AI can enhance eﬃciency, lower costs, improve customer experience, and \\ndrive revenue growth. What is agentic AI? \\nAgentic AI generally refers to AI systems that \\npossess the capacity to make autonomous \\ndecisions and take actions to achieve speciﬁc \\ngoals with limited or no direct human \\nintervention3. \\nKey aspects of agentic AI \\nAutonomy: Agentic AI systems \\ncan operate independently, \\nmaking decisions based on their \\nprogramming, learning, and \\nenvironmental inputs. \\nGoal-oriented behaviour:  These \\nAI agents are designed to pursue \\nspeciﬁc objectives, optimising \\ntheir actions to achieve the \\ndesired outcomes. \\nEnvironment interaction:  An \\nagentic AI interacts with its \\nsurroundings, perceiving changes \\nand adapting its strategies \\naccordingly. \\nLearning capability:  Many \\nagentic AI systems employ \\nmachine learning or \\nreinforcement learning techniques \\nto improve their performance over \\ntime. \\nWorkﬂow optimisation: Agentic \\nAI agents enhance workﬂows and \\nbusiness processes by integrating \\nlanguage understanding with \\nreasoning, planning, and \\ndecision-making. This involves \\noptimising resource allocation, \\nimproving communication and \\ncollaboration, and identifying \\nautomation opportunities. \\nMulti-agent and system \\nconversation: Agentic AI \\nfacilitates communication \\nbetween diﬀerent agents to \\nconstruct complex workﬂows. It \\ncan also integrate with other \\nsystems or tools, such as email, \\ncode executors, or search \\nengines, to perform a variety of \\ntasks. \\nAutonomy Goal-oriented \\nbehaviour Workﬂow \\noptimisation Environment \\ninteraction Learning \\ncapability \\nMulti-agent \\nand system \\nconversation Evolution to multimodal GenAI agents \\nIn AI, the only constant is change—embrace a culture of perpetual innovation. \\nThe journey of agentic frameworks began as simple, rule-based systems designed to perform speciﬁc tasks. Over time, \\nthese systems have evolved into sophisticated, multimodal agents capable of processing and integrating information from \\nvarious sources, such as text, images, and audio. Multimodality capabilities allow AI agents to understand, employ \\nreasoning, and interact like humans, enhancing their eﬀectiveness and versatility to solve a wide range of business \\nproblems4. \\nGoal-oriented \\nbehaviour AI agent Integration of ML (2000s) \\nLearning from data NLP enabled user \\ninteractions \\nIntegration of Machine Learning (2000s) \\nLearning from Data Natural Language Processing \\n(NLP) Enabled User \\nInteractions: Introduction of multimodality (2010s) \\nCombining text, images, and \\naudio Enhanced user interactions \\nIntegration of Machine Learning (2000s) \\nLearning from Data Natural Language Processing \\n(NLP) Enabled User \\nInteractions: Advanced autonomy and real-time interactions (2020s-present) \\nHuman-like reasoning and \\nadvanced autonomy User interactions within an \\nethical and responsible AI- \\ncontrolled environment           The evolution can be broken down into three key phases: \\n1. Integration of Machine Learning (ML) \\n○Learning from data:  The integration of ML allowed agents to learn from large datasets, improving their ability \\nto make decisions and perform tasks. This was a signiﬁcant step forward from rule-based systems, as agents \\ncould now adapt to new information and improve over time. \\n○Natural Language Processing (NLP) enabled user interactions:  Advances in NLP enabled agents to \\nunderstand and generate human language more eﬀectively, making interactions more natural and intuitive. \\n2. Introduction of multimodality \\n○Combining text, images, and audio:  Multimodal agents emerged, capable of processing and integrating \\ninformation from various sources. For instance, an agent could analyse a text description, recognise objects in \\nan image, and understand spoken commands. This multimodality made agents more versatile and capable of \\nhandling complex tasks. \\n○Enhanced user interactions:  Multimodal agents could interact with users in more dynamic ways, such as \\nproviding visual aids in response to text queries or understanding context from a combination of spoken and \\nvisual inputs. \\n3. Advanced autonomy and real-time interactions \\n○Advanced autonomy:  Agents can operate independently, rationalise and set their own goals, develop path(s) \\nto attain these goals, and make independent decisions without constant human intervention, leveraging data \\nfrom multiple sources or synthetic datasets. In a multi-agentic orchestration system, the ﬁrst set of agents \\nfocus on mimicking human behaviour (e.g. ChatGPT-4o), that is, thinking fast to come up with solution \\napproach, while the second set of agents focus on slow reasoning (e.g. ChatGPT-1o) to come up with a vetted \\nsolution5. Combining thinking fast and slow reasoning, agents can process information and make optimal \\ndecisions in real-time – crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles, real-time customer service, and \\nvarious mission-critical business processes. This autonomy makes agentic AI particularly powerful in dynamic \\nand complex real-world environments.  \\n○User interactions within an ethical and responsible AI-controlled environment:  With increased \\ncapabilities, there has also been a focus on ensuring that agentic systems operate ethically and responsibly, \\nconsidering factors such as bias, transparency, and accountability. (2000s)\\n(2010s)\\n2020s- \\npresentWhy organisations should pay attention \\nIn the fast lane of technological evolution, missing the AI turn today means being outpaced tomorrow. \\nAgentic AI oﬀers signiﬁcant advantages in eﬃciency, decision-making, and customer interaction. By automating routine \\ntasks and providing intelligent insights, agentic AI can help organisations save time, reduce cost, and improve overall \\nproductivity. Moreover, organisations who adopt an agentic AI system can gain a competitive advantage by leveraging its \\ncapabilities to innovate and enhance their business operations. Lower cost to entry and economies of scale makes it \\nfavourable for organisations to fully harness the capabilities it oﬀers compared to its predecessors like traditional ML and \\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA)-driven automations. \\nAgentic AI systems can signiﬁcantly enhance an organisation’s competitive edge by automating complex workﬂows, \\nreducing operational costs, and improving decision-making processes. These systems are designed to adapt to changing \\nbusiness environments, driving higher productivity and enabling organisations to stay competitive. For example, agentic AI \\ncan predict market trends and customer preferences, allowing businesses to tailor their strategies proactively. This \\nadaptability not only improves eﬃciency but also fosters innovation, giving companies a signiﬁcant edge over competitors6.\\nMoreover, agentic AI systems can handle large volumes of data and extract actionable insights, which can be used to \\noptimise operations and enhance customer experiences. By automating routine tasks, these systems free up human \\nresources to focus on more strategic initiatives, thereby increasing overall organisational agility and responsiveness7.\\n \\nAgentic AI systems can analyse vast amounts of data quickly and accurately, providing valuable insights to inform better \\ndecision-making. Businesses can leverage these insights to optimise revenue and operations, identify market trends, and \\nmake data-driven decisions. For instance, in the ﬁnancial sector, AI can analyse market data to predict trends, inform \\ninvestment strategies, and boost investment ROI. In retail, it can streamline inventory management by predicting demand \\nand optimising stock levels. \\nAgentic AI can signiﬁcantly enhance business eﬃciency and productivity by automating routine tasks and processes. This \\nallows employees to focus on more strategic and creative activities. For example, in customer service, agentic AI can \\nhandle common inquiries, freeing up human agents to tackle more complex issues. In manufacturing, AI-driven robots can \\nmanage repetitive tasks with precision and consistency, reducing errors and increasing output. \\nBy integrating agentic AI, businesses can oﬀer personalised and responsive customer experiences. AI-driven chatbots and \\nvirtual assistants can provide instant support, answer queries, and even recommend products based on customer \\npreferences and dynamic interactions. This improves customer satisfaction, builds loyalty, and drives sales. For example, \\ne-commerce platforms use AI to recommend products based on browsing history and purchase behaviour. \\nEnhanced decision-making \\nBoosted eﬃciency and productivity \\nImproved customer experience \\nAgentic AI systems are redeﬁning customer service centres and are gaining popularity as a game-changing capability \\nfor both government entities and private sector organisations. While traditional rule-based chatbots \\n(software-as-a-service) provided basic 24/7 support, and Retrieval Augmented Generated (RAG)-based chatbots \\nenhanced human-like interactions (enhanced software-as-a-service), agentic AI surpasses both in terms of accuracy, \\ncontextual coherence, and problem-solving ability. \\nIn terms of accuracy, rule-based chatbots are limited to programmed responses, causing inaccuracies when queries \\nfall outside of predeﬁned rules. RAG-based chatbots depend on retrieved data that may not match user intent. In \\ncontrast, the novel approach of agentic AI allows it to understand nuances in language, generating accurate responses \\neven to complex or unseen queries. Its ability to learn from vast datasets enhances precision and adaptability, making \\nit superior for customer interactions. \\nOne of the biggest limitations of chatbots has been contextual coherence. Rule-based chatbots struggle to maintain \\ncontext in extended interactions due to linear scripting, leading to disjointed responses that harm customer \\nexperience. RAG-based chatbots may produce inconsistent replies if retrieval mechanisms don\\'t consider previous \\ninteractions. Whereas agentic AI’s orchestration capability helps it excel at tracking conversation history, \\nunderstanding dialogue ﬂow, ensuring responses remain contextually appropriate and coherent, signiﬁcantly boosting \\ncustomer engagement. \\nThus far, both rule-based and RAG-based chatbots have limited autonomous problem-solving ability. The former can\\'t \\nhandle problems outside their scripts while the latter provide information but can\\'t synthesise data and prepare the \\nhuman-live problem-solving logic to solve complex issues across integrated sources such as CRMs, ERP, or IVR \\nsystems. The agentic AI performs dynamic reasoning and decision-making, leveraging a series of autonomous agents, \\nanalysing customer issues, considering multiple factors, and applying learned knowledge to resolve problems more \\neﬃciently. The outcome is quicker, solution-oriented, and ﬂuid conversations that enhance customer experience and \\nset new standards for eﬃciency and responsiveness in automated customer service.

This innovative approach transforms manual labour into automated, AI-driven \\nservices. Rather than purchasing traditional software licences or subscribing to cloud-based software-as-a-service \\n(SaaS), businesses can now pay for speciﬁc outcomes delivered by AI agents. For example, a company might employ \\nAI customer support agents like Sierra to resolve issues on their websites, paying per resolution rather than maintaining \\na costly human support team. This model allows organisations to access a wider range of services – whether it’s legal \\nsupport from AI-powered lawyers, continuous cybersecurity testing by AI penetration testers, or automated CRM \\nmanagement – at a fraction of the cost. This not only drives eﬃciency but also signiﬁcantly reduces operational \\noverheads. \\nBy leveraging the service-as-a-software model, businesses can automate both routine and highly specialised tasks that \\nwere once time-consuming, required skilled professionals, and typically involved expensive software licences or cloud \\nsolutions. AI applications with advanced reasoning capabilities can now handle complex tasks, from software \\nengineering to running customer care centres, enabling companies to scale their operations without a proportional \\nincrease in cost. This transition expands the services available to organisations of all sizes, freeing them to focus on \\nstrategic priorities while AI systems manage the operational burden. Adopting these AI-driven services positions \\nbusinesses to stay competitive in an ever-evolving marketplace8.\\nService-as-a-software represents an outcome-focused, strategic shift, enabling organisations to transition from their \\ncurrent state to operating in \"copilot\" and ultimately \"autopilot\" modes. Sierra, for instance, oﬀers a safety net by \\nescalating complex customer issues to human agents when necessary, ensuring a seamless customer experience. \\nWhile not all AI solutions oﬀer this built-in fallback, a common strategy is to initially deploy AI in a \"copilot\" role \\nalongside human workers. This human-in-the-loop approach helps organisations build trust in AI capabilities over time. \\nAs AI systems demonstrate their reliability, businesses can conﬁdently transition to an \"autopilot\" mode, where AI \\noperates autonomously, enhancing eﬃciency and reducing the need for human oversight. GitHub Copilot is a prime \\nexample of this, assisting developers and potentially automating more tasks as it evolves. \\nFor organisations with high operational costs, outsourcing speciﬁc tasks to AI services that guarantee concrete \\noutcomes is an increasingly attractive option. Take Sierra, for example: businesses integrate Sierra into their customer \\nsupport systems to eﬃciently manage customer queries. Instead of paying for software licences or cloud-based \\nservices, they pay Sierra based on the number of successful resolutions. This outcome-based model aligns costs \\ndirectly with the results delivered, allowing organisations to harness AI for speciﬁc tasks and pay solely for the \\noutcomes achieved. \\nThis shift from traditional software licences or cloud SaaS to service-as-a-software is transformative in several ways: \\nTargeting service proﬁts: Traditional SaaS focused on selling user seats, whereas service-as-a-software taps into \\nservice proﬁt pools, delivering solutions that focus on speciﬁc business outcomes. \\nOutcome-based pricing: Instead of charging per user or seat, service-as-a-software adopts a pricing model based on \\nthe actual outcomes achieved, directly aligning costs with results. \\nHigh-touch delivery models: Service-as-a-software oﬀers a top-down, highly personalised approach, providing \\ntrusted, tailored solutions that meet the speciﬁc operational needs of businesses. \\nTransitioning from copilot to autopilot models \\nOutsourcing work through AI services Why should organisations consider early \\nadoption and avoid being late movers? \\nLate movers Early adopters \\nMarket \\nposition Set industry benchmarks  \\nand gain ﬁrst-mover \\u2009market advantage. \\nStruggle to catch up and miss out on \\ncreating competitive advantage. \\nInnovation Leverage AI to innovate business \\nprocesses, deploy the AI solutions \\neﬀectively and create diﬀerentiation. Slow to innovate business processes and \\ntake full advantage of AI solutions to create \\ndiﬀerentiation. \\nCustomer \\nrelationships Build deeper customer relationships \\nthrough personalised and newer \\nexperiences. Play catch-up to match the personalised \\nservices of early adopters. \\nOperational \\neﬃciency Streamline operations and reduce \\noperational cost early on. Higher lost opportunity cost due to late entry \\nand adoptions. \\nLearning curve Beneﬁt from the initial learning curve and \\nshape industry standards. Miss out on early learning opportunities and \\nindustry inﬂuence. \\nMarket share Increase market share and proﬁtability \\nthrough early adoption. Struggle to achieve similar market share. \\nBarriers to \\nentry Create barriers for competitors through \\ndeep AI integration. Face higher barriers to entry due to \\nestablished competitors. \\nCost to entry Pay relatively higher cost of entry and \\niterative test-and-learn due to new AI \\nsolutions. Pay relatively lower cost of entry and lower \\nlearning and experiments.

R. Lane \\nSchool of Computer Science, University of Hertfords hire \\nHatfield \\nUnited Kingdom \\np.c.lane@herts.ac.uk \\n \\nSynonyms \\n \\nDefinition \\nA chunk is meaningful unit of information built from smalle r pieces of information, and chunking is the \\nprocess of creating a new chunk. Thus, a chunk can be seen as a collection of elements that have stron g \\nassociations with one another, but weak association s with elements belonging to other chunks. Chunks, which \\ncan be of different sizes, are used by memory syste ms and more generally by the cognitive system. With in \\nthis broad definition, two further meanings can be differentiated. First, chunking can be seen as a de liberate, \\nconscious process. Here, we talk about goal-oriented chunking . Second, chunking can be seen as a more \\nautomatic and continuous process that occurs during  perception. Here, we talk about perceptual chunking. \\n \\nTheoretical Background \\nChunking as a mechanism was initially proposed by D e Groot (1946/1978) in his study of chess experts’ << \\nlink to Development of expertise>> perception, memo ry and problem solving, to explain their ability to  \\nrecall briefly presented positions with a high leve l of precision. It was also a central ingredient of  Miller’s \\n(1956) classical article about the limits on human information-processing capacity. Miller proposed th at chunk \\nare the correct measure for the information in the human cognitive system, and that 7 ± 2 chunks can b e held in short-term memory. Chase and Simon (1973) p roposed a general theory of processes underpinning \\nchunking. It is interesting to note that the approa ches of De Groot as well as Chase and Simon emphasi ze \\nthe implicit nature of chunks, that are seen as the  product of automatic learning processing sometimes  called \\nperceptual chunking. Miller’s view emphasizes a type of strategic, goal-oriented chunking , where chunking is \\nessentially re-coding of the information in a more efficient way. For example, the 9-digit binary numb er \\n101000111 can be re-coded as the 3-digit decimal nu mber 327, making it easier to process and memorize for \\nhumans. The presence of chunks explains how humans,  in spite of strict cognitive limitations in memory  \\ncapacity, attention, and learning rate, can cope ef ficiently with the demands of the environment. Chun king \\nhas been established as one of the key mechanisms o f human cognition, and plays an important role in \\nshowing how internal cognitive processes are linked  to the external environment. \\nThere is considerable empirical evidence supporting  the notion of a chunk, for example in our ability to \\nperceive words, sentences or even paragraphs as sin gle units, bypassing their representation as collec tions of \\nletters or phonemes; this explains, for example, ho w skilled readers may be insensitive to word repeti tion or \\ndeletion. Particularly strong evidence is found in those studies which use information about the timin g of \\nresponses to infer the presence of chunks. The use of response times assumes that the output of elemen ts \\nwithin a chunk will be faster than the output of el ements across different chunks. This is because the  \\nelements within a chunk belong to the same structur e, as well as sharing a number of relations. There is good \\nempirical evidence confirming that subjects’ pauses  are shorter within chunks than between chunks. For  \\nexample, timing information shows that when the alp habet is recited back, letters are grouped in clusters, a nd \\nclusters grouped in super-clusters. When trained to  learn alphabets using scrambled letter orders, sub jects also \\nrecall letters in a burst of activity followed by a  pause, and therefore show evidence for clusters. \\nThe strongest empirical evidence for chunks is base d on their inference from several converging method s. \\nFor example, studies on chess have shown that chunk s identified by latencies in recall or placement of  chess \\npieces correlate highly with chunks identified by t he number of relations shared between successively placed \\npieces. By analyzing the patterns picked out by che ss players within a position for various natural re lations \\n(including proximity, color, and relations of attac k or defense), it is evident that within-chunk rela tions are \\nmuch stronger than between-chunk relations. This pa ttern was found whether the subjects were asked to \\nplace pieces on the board from memory (using timing s to separate the groups), or to copy a board (usin g the \\npresence of glances between the two boards to separ ate the groups). Further empirical evidence for chu nking \\nhas been uncovered in a number of other areas inclu ding artificial-grammar learning, problem solving, and \\nanimal research. \\nThe chunking theory, developed by Chase and Simon (1973) was an importa nt attempt to formalize the \\nmechanisms linked to chunking. It postulated that a ttention is serial and short-term memory limited to  about \\nseven items (Miller’s magical number). When individ uals acquire information about a domain with practi ce \\nand study, they acquire an increasingly larger numb er of chunks, which themselves tend to become large r, up to a limit of four or five items. While learning is  assumed to be slow (10 seconds per chunk), recogni tion of \\nthe information stored in a chunk occurs in a matte r of hundreds of milliseconds. Another important \\nassumption is that chunks are linked to possible in formation. For example, in chess, the domain in whi ch the \\ntheory was first applied, a chunk could provide inf ormation about potentially useful moves (see Figure  1). \\nChunks help in a recall task, because groups of pie ces rather than individual pieces can be stored in short-\\nterm memory. They also help in a problem-solving ta sk, because some of the chunks, being linked to \\npotentially useful information, provide clues about  what kind of action should be taken. \\nFigure 1. Top panel: examples of chunks in a chess position. Bottom panel: one of the chunks elicits a  \\npossible move (retreating the white bishop). \\n \\nThere is also evidence that people, in particular e xperts in a domain, use higher-level representation s than \\nchunks. For example, data from chess research indic ate that sometimes the entire position, up to 32 pi eces, is \\nhandled as a single unit by grandmasters. In additi on, evidence from expertise research indicates that  \\ninformation can sometimes be encoded in long-term m emory faster than the 10 seconds proposed by \\nchunking theory. Together, these results led to a r evision of the chunking theory with the template theory \\n(Gobet & Simon, 1996). The template theory proposes  that frequently used chunks become “templates”, a \\ntype of schema. A template consists of a core, which contains constant information, and slots, where variable \\ninformation can be stored. The presence of template s considerably expands experts’ memory capability. The image cannot be displayed. Your computer may no t have enough memory to open the image, or the imag e may have been corrupted. Restart your computer, a nd then open the file again. If the red x still app ears, you may have to delete the image and then ins ert it again.A methodological difficulty with research on chunki ng has been to precisely identify the boundaries be tween \\nchunks. For example, the most direct explanation fo r observing a set of actions as a chunk is for the actions \\nto be represented internally as a single unit, i.e.  a chunk, and so retrieved and output together. How ever, it is \\nalso possible for a subject to plan output actions ahead, and so either break long sequences into sub- parts \\n(e.g., to take a breath when reciting the alphabet)  or else compose short sequences into what appear a s longer \\nones (e.g., where a second chunk begins naturally f rom where the first one finished). Distinguishing b etween \\nthese types is only possible with the aid of a comp utational model, where the precise items of informa tion \\nknown by the subject at a given point in time can b e ascertained (Gobet et al., 2001). The advantage o f using \\ncomputer models is discussed in more detail in the entry on Learning in the CHREST cognitive architect ure, \\na model based on the template theory. \\nChunk-based theories, such as the chunking and temp late theories, not only provide a powerful explanat ion \\nof learning and expert behavior, but also offer use ful information as to how learning occurs in the cl assroom \\nand how it could be improved (Gobet, 2005). We brie fly discuss some of the implications for education \\n(further principles are listed in Table 1). \\n \\nTable 1. Educational principles derived from chunk- based theories (after Gobet, 2005). \\n \\n• Teach from the simple to the complex \\n• Teach from the known to the unknown \\n• The elements to be learned should be clearly identi fied \\n• Use an ‘improving spiral,’ where you come back to t he same concepts and ideas and add \\nincreasingly more complex new information \\n• Focus on a limited number of types of standard prob lem situations, and teach the various methods \\nin these situations thoroughly \\n• Repetition is necessary. Go over the same material several times, using varying points of view and \\na wide range of examples \\n• At the beginning, don’t encourage students to carry  out their own analysis of well-known problem \\nsituations, as they do not possess the key concepts  yet \\n• Encourage students to find a balance between rote l earning and understanding \\n  \\nA first implication of chunk-based theories is that  acquiring a new chunk has a time cost, and therefo re time \\nat the task is essential, be it in mathematics or d ancing. As documented by research into deliberate p ractice \\n<<link to Deliberate practice>>, practice must be t ailored to the goal of improving performance. Chunk -\\nbased theories give attention a central role – see for example the CHREST model – and such theories ar e therefore suitable models of deliberate practice. I n particular, conceptual knowledge is built on perc eptual \\nskills, which in turn must be anchored on concrete examples. Thus, curricula should provide means to a cquire \\nperceptual chunks in a given domain. \\nThere are different useful ways to direct attention  and to encourage the acquisition of perceptual chu nks: to \\nsegment the curriculum into natural components, of the right size and difficulty; to present these \\ncomponents with an optimal ordering and suitable fe edback; and to highlight the important features of a \\nproblem. \\nIf perceptual chunking is an important way of stori ng knowledge, then a clear consequence is that tran sfer \\nwill be difficult. Unfortunately for learners, this  prediction is correct, both for school knowledge a nd more \\nspecific skills such as sports and arts. More than 100 years of research have established that transfe r is \\npossible from one domain to another only when the c omponents of the skills required in each domain \\noverlap. Thus, it might be helpful to augment the t eaching of specific knowledge with the teaching of \\nmetaheuristics – including strategies about how to learn, how to direct one’s attention, and how to mo nitor \\nand regulate one’s limited cognitive resources. \\nAs noted above, an important idea in Chase and Simo n’s (1973) theory is that perceptual chunks can be used \\nas conditions to actions, thus leading to the acqui sition of productions. Then, an important aspect of  \\neducation is to balance the acquisition of the cond ition and action parts of productions . Another important \\naspect of education is to favor the acquisition of templates (schemata). Templates are created when th e \\ncontext offers both constant and variable informati on. As a consequence, and as is well established in  the \\neducational literature, it is essential to have var iability during learning if templates are to be cre ated. \\nFinally, chunk-based theories are fairly open to th e possibility of large individual differences in pe ople’s \\ncognitive abilities. In particular, while they post ulate fixed parameters for short-term memory capaci ty and \\nlearning rates, it is plausible that these paramete rs vary between individuals. In addition, differenc es in \\nknowledge will lead to individual differences in pe rformance. A clear prediction of chunk-based theori es is \\nthat individual differences play a large role in th e early stages of learning, as is typical of classr oom \\ninstruction, but tend to be less important after la rge amounts of knowledge have been acquired through  \\npractice and study. \\n \\nImportant Scientific Research and Open Questions \\nChunk-based theories have spurred vigorous research  is several aspects of learning and expertise. A fi rst \\naspect is the acquisition of language, where recent  research has shown that chunking plays an importan t role \\nin the development of vocabulary and syntactic stru ctures. A second aspect is related to the neurobiol ogical basis of chunking. Recent results indicate that per ceptual chunks are stored in the temporal lobe, and  in \\nparticular the parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform g yrus. \\nOther issues being currently researched include the  effect of order in learning, and in particular how  curricula \\ncan be designed so that that they optimize the tran smission of knowledge. A possible avenue for future  \\nresearch is the design of computer tutors that use chunking principles for teaching various materials,  \\noptimizing instruction for the abilities and level of each student by providing personalized curricula , \\nproviding judicious feedback, and teaching strategi es. \\n \\nCross-References \\n→ Bounded rationality and learning \\n→ Decision making and learning \\n→ Deliberate practice \\n→ Development of expertise \\n→ Learning in the CHREST cognitive architecture \\n→ Schema \\n References \\n1.

To improve the \\nsearch experience, it uses  effective indexing and retrieval \\ntechniques, mov able filters, and a simple search interface.  \\nLangChain also allows users to save queries, create bookmarks, \\nand annotate important sections, enabling efficient retrieval of \\nrelevant information from PDF documents. The features of \\nLangChain increase overal l efficiency and makes PDF querying \\nmuch easier and  simpler .  \\nKeywords —LangChain , Querying PD F, Streamlit.  \\nI.
