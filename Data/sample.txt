Title: Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised Learning – where the model is trained on labeled data.
2. Unsupervised Learning – where the model identifies patterns from unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning – where an agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Supervised learning includes tasks like classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., predicting house prices). Unsupervised learning involves clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Popular algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Means Clustering
- Neural Networks

Real-world applications of machine learning include:
- Personalized recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)
- Fraud detection in banking
- Self-driving cars
- Medical diagnosis assistance
- Chatbots and virtual assistants

As the amount of data grows, machine learning plays a vital role in extracting actionable insights, automating tasks, and enabling intelligent systems.
